# Principal_Component_Analysis

The application of Principal Component Analysis on Olivetti face images dataset was made. Olivetti face images dataset have 400 pictures and 4096 features which are representing the pixels of a 64x64 picture.

The mean face image was found by calculating the average of all samples from that dataset.

The dimensionality was reduced from 64 to 20 and we have corresponding eigenvectors. That Eigenvectors were transformed into images and Eigen faces corresponding of each principal components was determined.
